# arkley-alebgra

The "arkley-algebra" module is a Rust crate designed to provide algebraic tools for solving high school (at this moment as its based on my maths level ðŸ˜…) algebra problems. It offers a collection of structs and functions that allow users to manipulate and solve algebraic expressions, equations, and operations commonly encountered in basic algebra.
