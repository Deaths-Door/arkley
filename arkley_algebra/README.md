# arkley-alebgra

The "arkley-algebra" module is a Rust crate designed to provide algebraic tools for solving high school (at this moment as its based on my maths level ðŸ˜…) algebra problems. It offers a collection of structs and functions that allow users to manipulate and solve algebraic expressions, equations, and operations commonly encountered in basic algebra.

## Note

While we strive to cover as many scenarios as possible, the complexity of mathematics means that achieving 100% accuracy in all cases and operations can be challenging. If you come across any issues or inaccuracies in the library, please don't hesitate to report them so that we can work on improving it. Your feedback is invaluable in helping us make the necessary enhancements.
