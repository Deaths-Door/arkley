## Discriminant:

- Calculate the discriminant (D) of a quadratic equation: D = b^2 - 4ac. 
- Use the discriminant to determine the nature of the roots:

### **Locales** :

**discriminant-integerquadratic** :
```
.haupttiel = The discriminant (D) is calculated as D = b^2 - 4ac
.subsitiute = subsitiute = Now substituting the values: \textbf{"{"} a = {$a}, b = { $b} ,c = { $c} {"}"} 
    we get \textbf{"{"} D = {$b}^2 - 4 * {$a} * {$b} {"}"} , which results in \textbf{"{"} D = {$result} {"}"} .
```

**roots-integerquadratic** :
```
.zero = Since  the discriminant (D) is less than 0 , the quadratic equation has no real roots
.one = Since the discriminant (D) is equal to 0, the quadratic equation has one repeating real root; {$root }
.two = Since the discriminant (D) is greater than 0, the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots; { $r1 } and { $r2 }
```
