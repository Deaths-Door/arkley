- Solve equations
- Calculate maximum or minimum values of expressions
- Implement `derivatives` , `integrations` and `sequences`
- Implement UI options for web, mobile, and command-line interfaces
- Add to REAMDE that this group of crates is extendable with custom types
- Add to REAMDE of each crate using describe about the `translations` directory
- Improve main README descripting all features crates offer , like `evalexpr` README
- Create buildscript to include (copy) `translations` via buildscript
- Deprecate `Expression::Nested` as it maybe is redundant
- Implement `try_from` for `integerquadratics` && `algebricquadractics` with expression and equation
- Solve quadratic equations by factoring or completing the square to find roots.
- Vertex Form Conversion: Implement methods to convert between standard form `(ax^2 + bx + c)` and vertex form `(a(x-h)^2 + k)`.
- Convert a quadratic equation to vertex form by completing the square.
- Given a quadratic equation in the form `y = ax^2 + kx + c`, or something similar , find the value of `k`
- Handles cases like `f(x) * f(x)`, possibly outputting `f(x)^2`.
- Describe operations (`+,-,*,/,^`), with expressions.
- Describe `try_make_subject` for equation
- Support for various units (`km` , `cm` ) with describe feature
- Add AlgebricQuadratics and intergate with quadratic trait with describe feature
- Improve REAMDE's to include all features
- Check why parser parses wrong when no spaced are given eg `2x+3`
- Add to README the sqrt + pow written / computer way is supported
- Add DescribePow/ DescribeSqrt for term , expression
