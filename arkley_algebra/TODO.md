- add replace variable with expr eg for quad formula and K 
- expand on simpilify structure for expr
- maybe add simpilicfier to remove unneeded zeros eg 0 + 5 can be written as 5 (in the tree)
- intergate equation with simpilify trait
- Finsih rearranger for equation
- Finish `build_expression_tree` with bracket support

# Quadratics 

**Note** : Requires `Describe` on equation and me knowing the maths
Solve using Vieta's Formulas  -> sum of roots && product of roots

Factor the quadratic equation to solve for the roots.
Complete the square to solve for the roots.
Use the square root property for simple quadratic equations.

Find Specific Values:

Determine the vertex (h, k) of a quadratic equation in vertex form (y = a(x - h)^2 + k).
Find the axis of symmetry, which is x = h.
Calculate the maximum or minimum value of the quadratic function.
 
Quadratic Inequalities:

Solve quadratic inequalities, which involve expressions like ax^2 + bx + c > 0 or ax^2 + bx + c < 0.

Completing the Square:

Convert a quadratic equation to vertex form by completing the square.

Finding "k":

Given a quadratic equation in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c, find the value of "k" for a specific x or y value.h.
