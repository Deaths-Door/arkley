# arkley

**arkley** is your multi-purpose cross-platform , lightweight, offline math library, goes beyond the conventional to offer in algebraic calculations and clear explanations of mathematical concepts,while providing a simple interface to use but provides power and versatility normally reserved for complicated math packages.

It aims to be a convenient and cost-effective solution for performing algebraic operations, with the option to toggle step-by-step explanations , designed to handle various data types (including intergating custom types into the crate) and provide accurate results for precise calculations with useful error messages, making it suitable for both learners and advanced users. 

It includes useful tools for everyday needs (such as currency conversion and unit conversion) , so explore customizable functions, unit calculations, symbolic math, and more in with an intuitive interface, available on desktop, mobile, web , command line and any platform that can run [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)


**Note:** This library  is currently in early development, and some features described below may not be fully implemented or may exhibit limitations. Your feedback and contributions are invaluable as we work towards refining the library. Thank you for your understanding and support during this phase.
