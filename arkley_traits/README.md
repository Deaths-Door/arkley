# arkley-traits

The `arkley-traits` crate provides essential traits for common mathematical operations, like calculating the least common multiple (LCM) and greatest common divisor (GCD) of values. These traits are designed to be used across various parts of the `arkley` calculator, allowing for efficient , generic and consistent mathematical calculations.

By implementing these traits for your custom numeric types, you can seamlessly integrate them into the `arkley` calculator and leverage its powerful mathematical functionality.

`Note` : This crate an essential tool for extending the calculator's capabilities with custom types.

## Note

While we strive to cover as many scenarios as possible, the complexity of mathematics means that achieving 100% accuracy in all cases and operations can be challenging. If you come across any issues or inaccuracies in the library, please don't hesitate to report them so that we can work on improving it. Your feedback is invaluable in helping us make the necessary enhancements.
